# PicoACM-Electron
A small, lightweight Access Control application for AdHoc situations.

## Backstory
A freind came to me with an issue of hosting a holiday party at a company, and wanted to implement access control.

It seems that largely, the infrastructure and initial investment for something so simple just didn't make sense.

So I thought it would be neat to build a simple cross-platform app that can satisfy this need.

## The goals
Lightweight (Relatively... it is electron, afterall)

No need for internet (Party in the desert?)

Operator Mode --> To station someone to handle the badging, if desired

Journal --> To log entries and exits in the database

## Installation
```bash
# clone the repo locally
git clone https://github.com/AndrewDavis1191/PicoACM-Electron.git
# start the app with npm
npm start
```
